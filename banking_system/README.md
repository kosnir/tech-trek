## Projects

1. [**Banking System**](https://github.com/ramalhaovitoria/tech-trek/blob/main/challenge%20-%20banking_system.py):  I had the opportunity to create a ***Banking System in Python***. The goal was to implement three essential operations: deposit, withdrawal, and statement. The system was developed for a bank looking to monetize its operations. During the challenge, I had the chance to apply my Python programming knowledge and build a functional system that simulated banking operations. I prepared to enhance my skills and demonstrated my ability to develop practical and efficient solutions.
   
2. [**Banking System - First Update**](https://github.com/ramalhaovitoria/tech-trek/blob/main/banking_system_update1.py): In this challenge, I worked on the optimized version of the previously developed ***Banking System*** using Python functions. The goal was to enhance the structure and efficiency of the system by implementing deposit, withdrawal, and statement operations in specific functions. I had the chance to refactor the existing code, breaking it into reusable functions to make the maintenance and understanding of the system as a whole easier.
